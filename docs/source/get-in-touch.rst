Get in touch
============

We are glad you want to get in touch!

If you want to send a proposal, please read the :doc:`contributing <contributing>`
section first, it will make your life easier.

You can get in touch with us in different ways:

* you can send an email to interop-dev@lists.funkfeuer.at
* you can subscribe to the `interop-dev mailing list <https://lists.funkfeuer.at/mailman/listinfo/interop-dev>`_
* you can reach us via `github <https://github.com/interop-dev/netjson>`_

We prefer the mailing list to discuss but we also like to keep track of proposals on github.

You may also want to read the `interop-dev archives <https://lists.funkfeuer.at/pipermail/interop-dev/>`_
to read past discussions.
