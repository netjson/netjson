Netjsongraph.js: canvas and geographic data
-------------------------------------------

`netjsongraph.js <https://github.com/netjson/netjsongraph.js>`_ is a javascript library based on d3
that allows visualization of `NetJSON NetworkGraph <http://netjson.org/docs/what.html#networkgraph>`_ objects. The library uses SVG for visualization,
which can be quite slow when many elements are shown, therefore we would like to try switching to canvas.

We also need an optional mode in which the network is displayed on a map.

**Measurable outcomes**:

- Rewrite the visualizer to use canvas
- Add an optional map mode
- Modernize javascript code organization: you may want to use some modern JS tool for building the
  library, you may rewrite the code in ES6, up to you
- Update documentation and examples in README

Implement NetJSON DeviceMonitoring in ubus (OpenWRT/LEDE)
---------------------------------------------------------

Implement NetJSON DeviceMonitoring output in `ubus <https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/techref/ubus>`_ (OpenWRT/LEDE).

We need a way to retrieve a `NetJSON DeviceMonitoring <http://netjson.org/docs/what.html#devicemonitoring>`_
object directly from the command line interface.

A good way to implement this would be to do it via ubus, like `nodewatcher-agent ubus API
<https://github.com/wlanslovenija/nodewatcher-agent#ubus-api>`_.

**Measurable outcomes**:

- Implement a way to retrieve a `NetJSON DeviceMonitoring <http://netjson.org/docs/what.html#devicemonitoring>`_ object via ubus
- Document the compilation/install process and the usage of the module on the README

Convert netengine output to NetJSON DeviceMonitoring
-----------------------------------------------------

`netengine <https://github.com/ninuxorg/netengine>`_ is an abstraction layer for extracting information
from network devices. It was developed prior to NetJSON and it has helped us understanding that we
needed a common format like NetJSON.

We want to change the library so it can return `NetJSON DeviceMonitoring <http://netjson.org/docs/what.html#devicemonitoring>`_ output.

**Measurable outcomes:**

- Change the JSON output to match `NetJSON DeviceMonitoring <http://netjson.org/docs/what.html#devicemonitoring>`_
- Implement mocking in tests
- Add compatibility for OpenWRT Chaos Calmer, Designated Driver and LEDE
- Add compatibility for AirOS 7
- Update the documentation contained in the repository

Implement NetJSON NetworkGraph output in B.A.T.M.A.N. Advanced
--------------------------------------------------------------

`B.A.T.M.A.N. Advanced <https://www.open-mesh.org/projects/batman-adv/wiki>`_ is a layer2 routing
deamon widely deployed in mesh networks.

It ships a tool called ``batadv-viz`` that returns different output formats that can be used
to visualze the network.

We want to add `NetJSON NetworkGraph <http://netjson.org/docs/what.html#networkgraph>`_ output to
``batadv-viz``.

**Measurable outcomes:**

- Implement `NetJSON NetworkGraph <http://netjson.org/docs/what.html#networkgraph>`_ output in ``batadv-viz``
- Follow the development conventions used in ``batadv-viz``

Ansible plugin for netjsonconfig
--------------------------------

`Ansible <https://github.com/ansible/ansible>`_ is an IT automation tool that has been recently
gaining popularity also in the `OpenWRT <http://openwrt.org>`_ world.

We want to implement an ansible plugin that integrates `netjsonconfig <netjsonconfig.openwisp.org>`_
and allows using its two most interesting features, that is templates and context, in ansible.

It should be possible to define configuration templates, assign them to specific playbooks and define
specific configurations for hosts.

The configuration format format used by netjsonconfig is `NetJSON DeviceConfiguration <http://netjson.org/docs/what.html#deviceconfiguration>`_, but a *YAML*
conversion of *NetJSON* would be good as well. Support for both would be preferred.

**Measurable outcomes:**

- Implement an ansible module that integrates netjsonconfig in ansible and allows using
  `NetJSON DeviceConfiguration <http://netjson.org/docs/what.html#deviceconfiguration>`_ (or its *YAML* equivalent) to configure OpenWRT devices
- Achieve a test coverage higher than 80%
- Provide documentation using `python-sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/>`_

Raspbian backend for netjsonconfig
----------------------------------

Implement a `Raspbian <https://www.raspbian.org/>`_ backend in `netjsonconfig <netjsonconfig.openwisp.org>`_.

`NetJSON DeviceConfiguration <http://netjson.org/docs/what.html#deviceconfiguration>`_ has been implemented only on `OpenWRT <http://openwrt.org>`_:
implementing it on other systems will help to speed up the standardization process.

**Measurable outcomes:**

- The ``Raspbian`` backend must generate a configuration archive compatible with Raspbian Jessie
- The ``Raspbian`` backend schema must cover at least the following features:
    - general (eg: hostname)
    - ntp settings
    - network interface settings
    - wireless setttings
    - dns servers
    - dns search domains
    - static routes
    - files
- The general test coverage of the library must be kept higher than 95%
- The backend must be to be documented inside the `python-sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/>`_ docs dir
  contained in the *netjsonconfig* repo

PfSense backend for netjsonconfig
---------------------------------

Implement a `PfSense <https://pfsense.org/>`_ backend in `netjsonconfig <netjsonconfig.openwisp.org>`_.

`NetJSON DeviceConfiguration <http://netjson.org/docs/what.html#deviceconfiguration>`_ has been
implemented only on `OpenWRT <http://openwrt.org>`_: implementing it on other systems will help to
speed up the standardization process.

**Measurable outcomes:**

- The ``PfSense`` backend must generate a configuration archive compatible with PfSense 2.2.x
- The ``PfSense`` backend must generate a configuration archive compatible with PfSense 2.3.x
- The ``PfSense`` backend schema must cover at least 75% of the features offered by the PfSense
  web interface, with particular attention to interfaces, wireless settings, vlans, firewall rules and VPNs
- The general test coverage of the library must be kept higher than 95%
- The backend must be to be documented inside the `python-sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/>`_ docs dir
  contained in the *netjsonconfig* repo

AirOS backend for netjsonconfig
-------------------------------

Implement an `AirOS backend <https://www.ubnt.com/airmax/airos7/>`_ in `netjsonconfig <netjsonconfig.openwisp.org>`_.

`NetJSON DeviceConfiguration <http://netjson.org/docs/what.html#deviceconfiguration>`_ has been
implemented only on `OpenWRT <http://openwrt.org>`_: implementing it on other systems will
help to speed up the standardization process.

**Measurable outcomes:**

- The ``AirOs`` backend must generate a configuration archive compatible with AirOS 6.x and AirOS 7.x,
  two separate classes can be created if preferred
- The ``AirOs`` backend schema must cover at least 75% of the configuration features
  offered by *AirOS* web interface, with particular attention to interfaces, wireless settings and vlans
- The general test coverage of the library must be kept higher than 95%
- Both backends must be documented inside the `python-sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/>`_ docs dir
  contained in the *netjsonconfig* repo

netjsonconfig backward conversion
---------------------------------

As of today, `netjsonconfig <netjsonconfig.openwisp.org>`_ is only able to generate a native router
configuration (eg: `OpenWRT <http://openwrt.org>`_) from a
`NetJSON DeviceConfiguration <http://netjson.org/docs/what.html#deviceconfiguration>`_ object and not vice versa.

We want to add the backward conversion process into the library.

This project will require a thoughtful design, probably involving some serialization and deserialization mechanism.

Measurable outcomes:

- Backward ``generate()`` pocess: a configuration archive must be converted to
  `NetJSON DeviceConfiguration <http://netjson.org/docs/what.html#deviceconfiguration>`_ through the available backends
- Backward ``render()`` process: a configuration string (eg: uci export in OpenWRT) must be converted to NetJSON
- The general test coverage of the library must be kept higher than 95%
- The feature must be documented in the documentation files contained in the netjsonconfig repo
